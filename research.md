This paper studies the effect of crime on a household’s social capital. Using longitudinal information on households’ social capital and crime victimisation from India, we address identification concerns due to endogenous sorting and moving. We distinguish between the
direct effect to victims and the indirect effect to society due to the risk of victimisation. We find that direct crime victimisation leads to significant deterioration in households’ institutional trust (0.056σ) but increases their social networks (0.065σ) and civic engagement (0.072σ). We find similar indirect effects due to the risk of victimisation. Households’ expectations and their media exposure plausibly drive the results. The results are not explained by omitted variables or reverse causality. Our findings show that crime reduces trust but fosters social networks, civic engagement and community participation. Therefore, the overall effect of crime on the societal stock of social capital is ambiguous. </div>

Human behavior is influenced by both biology and social norms. Natural selection favors an increase in the ratio of females to males in times of adversity (war, food shortage, etc.). Is it possible that natural selection may be counteracted by social norms? We present novel evidence from Punjab — an Indian state with intense son-preferring norms rooted in culture. We find that exposure to a violent insurgency (1978-93) leaves the overall sex ratio unchanged and intensifies son-biased fertility stopping behaviors. Since most casualties are male, our results are consistent with exposed parents demanding more sons due to a replacement motive. </div>

We study the effect of civil unrest on learning outcomes of schoolgoing children. The context of the study is the Indian province of Jammu and Kashmir, a part of which (namely, the Kashmir valley) witnessed a sudden intensification in violence in 2010. We exploit this plausibly exogenous intensification in a difference-in-differences framework. Exposed children perform poorly on a basic (grade 2-3 level) literacy and numeracy test as compared to their non-exposed counterparts. The effects are fairly substantial in magnitude (about 0.54 σ and 0.37 σ for language and math, respectively), and persist for at least 2 years. All exposed students, including those in higher classes (grades 6-8 and 9-12), are affected. We provide suggestive evidence that reduced school quality and increased psychological stress amongst students may drive these results. </div>

We investigate the impact of access to informal finance on crime in India. Using within-household variation in membership in a popular informal financial institution (Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs)) in a nationally representative panel of households, we find that membership is associated with a higher probability of victimization in property crimes and heightened perception of the incidence of crimes against women in the neighborhood. This is plausibly driven by the “loot effect”: ROSCAs lead to more household assets, thus making members more attractive targets. Moreover, ROSCAs also lead to greater mobility for women and increases their chance of participating in the labor market. </div>

**Alcohol prohibition, home environment and learning: Evidence from India** (*with Deeksha, [Sounak Thakur](https://www.sites.google.com/view/sounakthakur/) and [Sarani Saha](https://iitk.ac.in/new/sarani-saha#)*)

We study the effects of alcohol prohibition on children's learning outcomes. The context of the paper is the Indian state of Bihar, which implemented a statewide ban on the manufacturing, sale, transport and consumption of alcohol in April, 2016. This policy induces plausibly exogenous variation in the availability of alcohol, which we exploit in a difference-indifferences framework. We find that the ban reduced alcohol consumption and improved the learning outcomes of school-going children in Bihar. The results are plausibly driven by lower domestic violence and improvements in the home environment induced by reduced alcohol consumption on the part of adult males. </div>
