We study the effect of civil unrest on learning outcomes of schoolgoing children. The context of the study is the Indian province of Jammu and Kashmir, a part of which (namely, the Kashmir valley) witnessed a sudden intensification in violence in 2010. We exploit this plausibly exogenous intensification in a difference-in-differences framework. Exposed children perform poorly on a basic (grade 2-3 level) literacy and numeracy test as compared to their non-exposed counterparts. The effects are fairly substantial in magnitude (about 0.54 σ and 0.37 σ for language and math, respectively), and persist for at least 2 years. All exposed students, including those in higher classes (grades 6-8 and 9-12), are affected. We provide suggestive evidence that reduced school quality and increased psychological stress amongst students may drive these results. </div>

We study the effects of alcohol prohibition on children’s learning outcomes. We exploit a plausibly exogenous change in the availability of alcohol in the Indian state of Bihar, which implemented a state-wide ban on the manufacturing, sale, transport and consumption of alcohol. Using a difference-in-differences framework, we find that the ban reduced alcohol consumption and improved the learning outcomes of school-going children in Bihar. The results are plausibly driven by lower domestic violence and improvements in the home environment induced by reduced alcohol consumption on the part of adult males. </div>
