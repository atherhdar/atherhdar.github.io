## Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, with a Ph.D. in Economics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. My research is guided by a central question: How do shocks &#8211;&#8211 whether driven by natural events or policy interventions &#8211;&#8211 shape peopleâ€™s lives and outcomes? My current work examines the consequences of violence for human and social capital, fertility choices, and economic well-being, while also investigating how household-level shocks influence education, health, and long-term development trajectories.
