## Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD student in the Economic Sciences Department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK). My broad research area is Applied Microeconomics, with a particular focus on Development Economics. My current research explores how exposure to various forms of violence impacts economic outcomes such as human capital accumulation, social capital, and fertility preferences. Additionally, I am investigating how household shocks, whether policy-driven or due to natural phenomenon, affect education, health, and other important economic outcomes.
