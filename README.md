## Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economic Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK), specializing in Applied Microeconomics with a particular focus on Development Economics. My research delves into the economic consequences of exposure to various forms of violence, examining its impact on outcomes such as human capital accumulation, social capital, and fertility preferences. Additionally, I explore how household-level shocks &#8211;&#8211; whether driven by policy interventions or natural events &#8211;&#8211; shape critical outcomes like education, health, and broader economic well-being.
